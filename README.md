# Ubuntu Server Auto Install 

Currently Using 16.04.2 LTS on my personal Server 64bit as of 8/2017  
Also tested with [Codeanywhere](https://codeanywhere.com) for Ubuntu 14LTS, and on [Codenvy](https://codenvy.io) for ubuntu 16 installs        

****I will be no longer be updating this Repo, For I have started up my own GitLab Server to contiune this work. For those that are following this Repo and forking it I hope you enjoy the work I have done so far. Thank you!!!

***10/23/2018 Just got notified the SickRage Repo now is own by its old Co-owner and has switched up keep team(s). I have found a different repo for this team at  https://github.com/SickChill/SickChill/ **

My setup is great for Fresh installs and for Reinstall with applying your current settings   
   
Steps are under Wiki for installation and creating the ISO   
Before creating ISO edit FirstbootInstall.sh for what programs to be install   

If anyone has ideas to help set up the process faster or add more programs to this list feel free to Click on the Feature Link  
  
Please see the wiki for futher information
